what's going on guys welcome back in this video today we're going to learn how to render latex formulas into images using python so let us get right into it [Music] all right so we're going to learn how to take latex formulas and turn those into PNG images that we can then use in blog posts or in documents that are not law Tech documents now for those of you who don't know what logic is at all it's essentially a software system that allows us to create documents or papers in a programmatic way so we can include packages we can use commands to Define sections we can have variables we can Define code sections we can Define algorithms especially with the different packages you have a lot of customizability and you don't have to use some graphical user interface stuff to say okay this is bold this is font size whatever this has this margin and stuff like that you can do everything in a programmatic kind of way however latex itself is not going to be the focus of this video one thing that you can do in log Tech is you can Define formulas or you can write formulas with the latex formula syntax so you can say you can use underscores for subscript you can use the exponentiation sign for superscript trip you can use backslash and then Greek Greek letters to show Greek letters and stuff like that and then you can render this using latex into a document that displays those formulas however we can also use Python to just take the formulas without a surrounding law Tech document to turn those formulas into images so that they end up looking like this instead of some cryptic syntax that you have to decipher this is a mathematical representation everyone understands this now I'm not sure if this makes sense I just input something here it doesn't have to make sense what's what's written here but this is what we're going to learn how to do today and for this we're going to need a couple of packages we're going to open up the command line and we're going to install matplotlip also pillow and PDF to image those are the three packages we're going to need today and once we have those installed we're going to open up a new python file here main.py and we're going to import now um matplotlib dot Pi plot splt then from pillow import image and then from PDF to image import convert from path because mat.lib I think is going to produce a PDF file if I remember that correctly I have my prepared code here on the second screen Matlock is going to produce a PDF file and then we need to transform this PDF file using pdf2 image into an image unless you want to have it as a PDF file of course then you can also keep that and the first thing we want to do is want to define a function that we're going to use latex to PDF to PNG sorry PDF is going to be just a step in between and what we take here as a parameter is a lot text string so law Tech Str and we're going to say now that we want to have a new figure in matplotlib so plt.figure and then we want to say PLT access off so that we have a nice plain background and then we want to say PLT text and here we're going to now say 0.50.5 for X and Y for the position and then we're going to use a formatted string and in log Tech what you need to do when you define formulas is you need to surround those with dollar signs and we can just say dollar dollar then we add here using curly brackets our python variable and our python variable is going to be a law text string so just so you have an example for those of you who are not familiar with latex if I want to say something like x to the power of 2 equals or let's let's do something different let's say Theta to the power of 2 equals x I would say dollar dollar backslash Theta to the power of 2 equals X or maybe I want to say X1 as a subscript so then I would say X1 uh something like this so this is how you write latex formulas and this is why we have to surround them with dollar signs here um besides that we're going to say that when I have a size of 50 we want to have a horizontal alignment of Center we want to have a vertical alignment of Center and that's basically it then what we're going to do is we're going to define a PDF path which is going to just be here um result dot PDF then we're going to have a PNG path and G path which is going to be a result of PNG and what we want to do now is we just want to say PLT safe figure and we're going to save um to the PDF path with the format not surprising PDF we're going to also then say that the boundary box inches should be tight but we want to have some padding so pad inches is going to be 0.4 then we want to say PLT close um the figure and that basically just creates a text and saves it into a PDF file that's the whole Magic behind that and now all we need to do is we need to say image um convert from PDF path or actually we need to say images because this by default produces a list even if it has just one element so we're going to say convert from from path PDF path and then we're going to say images index 0 even if there's only one image save PNG path and then PNG is the file type here that's the whole Magic so you can see actually the actual magic is happening in matte totalit this is all we need to do to render latex code we don't do anything manually here we just say okay matplotlip please render this text you have these dollar signs recognize this as a latte code and that's basically the whole Magic now we have Lata code rendered into an image then we save it as PDF then we convert it to PNG and what we're going to do then is we're going to return the PNG path optionally we don't have to we can also just re-enter It Here and Now what we do is we say La Tech code or latex formula rather is going to be something simple let's go with um Theta Theta to the power of 2. equals X1 plus Y2 or something like this this is a very simple one and now we're going to say PNG path equals latex to PNG law Tech formula and then all we want to do here is we want to say image equals is why we need pillow now because we want to display the image we want to open it up now if you don't want to open up the image after you created it you can also just not import pillow and not install pillow we just needed to open the image so we're going to say image dot open PNG path and then image show and that's the whole Magic that's our whole application here if I run this now you're going to see unless I made any mistake okay this is a problem Theta is not recognized um I think because of course in Python we have Escape characters so I have to double double backslash to actually get a backslash uh and then we have Theta squared equals X1 plus Y2 and of course I can do something more fancy here as well so I can go uh and say something like sum from not from sorry some underscore uh k equals zero and then uh to the power of n so this basically means sum from k equals zero up until n off and this is now the the third curly bracket combination here uh two and then maybe something like C dot k so that would be one idea for a from a formula here again we need to say backslash and we need to say I'm not even sure uh since backslash s is not an escape character I think this should work like this as well there you go so from k equals zero up until n now I'm wondering if this is false if I say backslash backslash or if this still works I think this should still work right yeah there you go so better to always do backslash backslash just keep it safe um here probably as well right so I think double backslash is never a bad a bad idea so yeah there you go uh and then maybe let's go with something more complicated let's do something like um some integral the crazy one that we had from before so we can say here a fraction uh where I have D and DX so D over DX just to indicate that I'm doing some derivative here um or some integral and then we can say left and then we can say here a uh in parentheses we want to have here the integral so int backslash int and then why is this common it out actually so remember we want to use double backslash everywhere so backstitch backslash backslash backslash integral uh from zero up until X and then inside of that we have f a few backslash comma d u right double backslash here again and then we have equals f of x again I'm not sure if this makes any sense I just made up something here but that would result in this year so you can just Google what the latte notation is but this is how you can automate this and the reason you want to do that is because oftentimes you're not going to work with law Tech but you want to have some formulas that you can just render into your blog post or something if you're writing about some mathematical stuff um and the blog post is not going to use law Tech maybe you don't want to install a plugin that renders law Tech maybe you don't want to use logic you want to use word but you want to have the law Tech formulas this is a very efficient way to do this especially if you have already a lot of formulas and you just want to automate the process of turning all of those into PNG files so that's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it and hope you
